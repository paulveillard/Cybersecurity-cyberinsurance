##  `What is Cyber Insurance? `

Cybersecurity insurance (cyber insurance) is a product that enables businesses to mitigate the risk of cyber crime activity like cyberattacks and data breaches. It protects organizations from the cost of internet-based threats affecting IT infrastructure, information governance, and information policy, which often are not covered by commercial liability policies and traditional insurance products. 

> Cyber insurance coverage works the same way as businesses would purchase insurance against physical risks and natural disasters. It covers the losses an enterprise may suffer as a result of a cyberattack.
